- Identify data sources and quality requirements
- Define success metrics (accuracy, latency, cost)
- Choose between LLM, fine-tuning, or RAG approaches

### 2. System Architecture
- Design retrieval and embedding strategies
- Plan prompt engineering workflow
- Define agent interaction patterns
- Assess infrastructure requirements

### 3. Implementation
- Build RAG pipelines with vector databases
- Optimize prompts through iterative refinement
- Implement multi-agent workflows
- Integrate with production systems

### 4. Evaluation & Optimization
- Measure prompt effectiveness
- Track model performance
- Optimize cost and latency
- Implement continuous learning
